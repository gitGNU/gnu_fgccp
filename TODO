--- BUGS ---

- Atributte values are not being recalculated
- Skill window doesn't redraw ?
- Can't read quirks with no newline if string.split is not used. How come?
  Doesn't string.strip() work correctly?

FIXED - Menu dissapears, pygtk bug?
        It turns out item_factory has to be referenced so it doesn't get
        freed.
